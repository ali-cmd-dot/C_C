## Configuration

The application is pre-configured with:
- **API Key**: `AIzaSyACruF4Qmzod8c0UlwfsBZlujoKguKsFDM`
- **Sheet IDs**: Pre-configured for your specific Google Sheets
- **Auto-refresh**: 5-minute intervals

### Google Sheets Structure Expected

#### Sheet 1: Misalignment_Tracking
- **Date**: DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY format
- **Vehicle Numbers**: Comma-separated vehicle IDs
- **Client Name**: Client identifier

#### Sheet 2: Alert_Tracking
- **Date**: DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY format
- **Alert Type**: Type of alert (filters out "No L2 alerts found")
- **Client Name**: Client identifier

#### Sheet 3: Issues- Realtime
- **Timestamp Issues Raised**: DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format
- **Timestamp Issues Resolved**: DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format
- **Issue**: Issue type (filters for "Historical Video Request")
- **Client**: Client identifier

## Technical Details

### Data Processing Logic

#### Misalignment Resolution Detection
```javascript
// If vehicle appears on Day 1 but not Day 2, it's considered resolved
const resolved = currentDayVehicles.filter(vehicle => 
  !nextDayVehicles.includes(vehicle)
);
```

#### Response Time Calculation
```javascript
// Calculates duration between raised and resolved timestamps
const responseTime = resolvedDate - raisedDate;
```

#### Date Parsing
Supports multiple formats:
- DD/MM/YYYY
- DD/MM/YY (auto-detects century)
- DD-MM-YYYY
- DD-MM-YY

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient data processing with minimal re-renders
- Responsive chart rendering
- Optimized bundle size
- Memory-efficient date parsing

## API Endpoints

The application fetches data from Google Sheets API:
```
https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{SHEET_ID}/values/{RANGE}?key={API_KEY}
```

## Browser Support
- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

## Security Features
- API key environment variable
- HTTPS enforcement
- XSS protection headers
- Content security policies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data not loading**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Google Sheets are publicly accessible
   - Confirm API key is valid

2. **Charts not displaying**
   - Ensure data format matches expected structure
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Date parsing issues**
   - Verify date format in sheets (DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY)
   - Check for empty date cells

### Error Messages
- "Failed to fetch data": Network or API issue
- "Loading Dashboard...": Normal loading state
- Charts showing "No data": Sheet structure mismatch
